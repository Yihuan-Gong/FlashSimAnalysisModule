## Package Overview

This package is designed to analyze the simulation results generated by the FLASH code. It emphasizes user-friendliness, allowing you to use the package with a straightforward and intuitive approach. With just one function call and by following the input prompts in your IDE, you can easily perform calculations.

This package is developed by integrating and extending the `yt` module and is structured with a well-maintained, scalable, and modular software architecture.

### Supported Analysis Features

* D: Numerical results can be obtained.
* P: Plotting capabilities.
* \-: Typically not used in research.
* X: Not feasible.

| Feature                 | 3D | 2D  | Profile | Time Series |
| ----------------------- | -- | --- | ------- | ----------- |
| Velocity filtering      | D  | D,P | -       | -           |
| Los velocity dispersion | -  | D,P | -       | -           |
| Turbulence heating      | D  | D,P | D,P     | D,P         |
| Radiative cooling       | D  | D,P | D,P     | D,P         |
| Other yt fields (\*1)   | X  | X   | P       | P           |

Note:
\*1 You can use this package to call `yt` module fields. For example, you can use it to plot the profile of the `("gas", "temperature")` field.
